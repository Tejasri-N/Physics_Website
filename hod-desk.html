          <p>
            It is with great pride that I share the recent developments and
            academic progress in the Department of Physics at IIT Hyderabad. Our
            department continues to evolve as a hub of advanced research,
            interdisciplinary learning, and high-quality teaching.
          </p>
          <p>
            In line with emerging national priorities and technological
            frontiers, we have recently introduced two new academic programs:
            the M.Tech. in Quantum and Solid State Devices (QSD) and the M.Sc.
            in Medical Physics. The M.Tech. in QSD is designed to equip students
            with strong foundations in quantum technologies and semiconductor
            device physics, preparing them to contribute meaningfully to the
            growing fields of quantum computing, nanoelectronics, and materials
            science. The M.Sc. in Medical Physics, developed with clinical
            relevance and academic rigor, aims to produce skilled professionals
            who can contribute to the healthcare sector, particularly in medical
            imaging, radiation therapy, and diagnostic technologies.

        <p>
          Our department is home to a dynamic team of faculty members and
          researchers engaged in a wide range of frontier areas in physics. We
          take pride in our growing infrastructure, collaborative research
          environment, and the enthusiastic participation of students in both
          theoretical and experimental domains.
        </p>
        <p>
          We welcome aspiring students, researchers, and industry collaborators
          to connect with us and be part of our journey in pushing the frontiers
          of physics.
