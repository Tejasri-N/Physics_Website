        It is with great pride that I share the recent developments and academic
        progress in the Department of Physics at IIT Hyderabad. Our department
        continues to evolve as a hub of advanced research, interdisciplinary
        learning, and high-quality teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        In line with emerging national priorities and technological frontiers,
        we have recently introduced two new academic programs: the M.Tech. in
        Quantum and Solid State Devices (QSD) and the M.Sc. in Medical Physics.
        The M.Tech. in QSD is designed to equip students with strong foundations
        in quantum technologies and semiconductor device physics, preparing them
        to contribute meaningfully to the growing fields of quantum computing,
        nanoelectronics, and materials science. The M.Sc. in Medical Physics,
        developed with clinical relevance and academic rigor, aims to produce
        skilled professionals who can contribute to the healthcare sector,
        particularly in medical imaging, radiation therapy, and diagnostic
        technologies.

      Our department is home to a dynamic team of faculty members and
      researchers engaged in a wide range of frontier areas in physics. We take
      pride in our growing infrastructure, collaborative research environment,
      and the enthusiastic participation of students in both theoretical and
      experimental domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      We welcome aspiring students, researchers, and industry collaborators to
      connect with us and be part of our journey in pushing the frontiers of
      physics.
